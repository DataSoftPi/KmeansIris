Exploring the K-Means clustering algorithm using synthetic and real-world data. 

Analysed clusters using metrics like inertia, conducted hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search, and visualized results. 

Insights into the strengths, limitations, and potential improvements for K-Means were drawn from experimentation with various datasets and algorithm parameters.
